The workshop part is divided into three parts each (I think) moar challanging than the other, so remember
to complete it step by step.

Open the part you want to practice and change the regex part into succesful regex.

Goal of each part is described in docstring at the beginning of the file.

Have fun!

P.S.: If you liked regex I created a bonus task. Simple but i think its cool.
